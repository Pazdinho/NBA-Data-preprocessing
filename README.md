# NBA Data preprocessing

This is the *SNBA Data preprocessing* project I made myself.


<p>Data preprocessing is one of the first steps in the machine learning workflow. The main idea is to transform raw data into a format that machine learning algorithms can easily understand. The predictive performance of a machine learning model highly depends on the input data quality. It's important to improve the quality of input data by removing the features with low predictive value, engineering new ones, and dealing with multicollinearity. With this project, I'll apply these concepts to NBA data to get a high-quality dataset ready to be fed to a linear model</p><br/><br/>
